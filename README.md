Pytorch version of the CVPR2014 paper: [L. Kang, P. Ye, Y. Li and D. Doermann, "Convolutional Neural Networks for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment," 2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Columbus, OH, 2014, pp. 1733-1740, doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2014.224.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6909620)

# Note
This training progress only support on LIVE II database now, the training progress on TID2013, CSIQ, LIVEMD, CLIVE will be release soon.

# Train
`python train.py`

# TODO
* Cross dataset test code will be published
* Train on different distortion types on LIVE, TID2013, CSIQ will be published
* Code of evaluations on Waterloo Exploration Database (D-test, L-test, P-test and gMAd competition) will be published

# Thanks
This code is based on the changes of [LiDingquan](https://github.com/lidq92/CNNIQA)
